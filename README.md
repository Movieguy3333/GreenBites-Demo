# GreenBites

A clean nutrition & sustainability logger where you search or describe meals, save entries, and see how your choices impact health and carbon footprint.

## Overview

GreenBites is a comprehensive nutrition tracking application that combines health monitoring with environmental consciousness. Users can log their meals through natural language descriptions, track nutritional information, and visualize their carbon footprint impact.

## Problem Statement

Many people want to eat healthier and reduce their environmental impact, but lack the tools to easily track and understand the relationship between their food choices and both personal health and carbon emissions. Existing nutrition apps focus solely on calories and macros, while environmental apps don't connect to personal eating habits. GreenBites bridges this gap by providing an integrated platform that makes sustainable eating accessible and actionable.

## Target Users

- **Health-conscious individuals** who want to track nutrition while considering environmental impact
- **Eco-conscious consumers** looking to reduce their carbon footprint through food choices
- **Fitness enthusiasts** who want comprehensive tracking including sustainability metrics
- **Families** seeking to make more informed food decisions for health and environmental reasons

## Core Features (MVP)

- [ ] **Food Search & Logging** - Integration with USDA/Nutritionix APIs for comprehensive nutrition data
- [ ] **Natural Language Meal Logging** - OpenAI-powered parsing of meal descriptions like "2 eggs and toast"
- [ ] **Carbon Footprint Tracking** - Real-time calculation of CO₂e emissions based on food categories
- [ ] **Interactive Dashboards** - Visual rings showing daily/weekly progress on calories, macros, and CO₂e
- [ ] **Favorites & Meal Templates** - Quick-add common meals and customizable meal templates
- [ ] **User Profiles & Goals** - Personalized targets for nutrition and environmental impact
